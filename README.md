# Ransome-killer
This is the project on ransomware detection using deep learning.

# Usage 
```
1. Put your ransomware pcap files in malware\_pcap and normal\_pcap
2. Run start.sh to extract features from pcap files
```
```
Use pcap_Parser -p if you want to parse TCP payloads
```

In our experiments, malware pcaps were referenced from [Malware-traffic-analysis](http://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/)

We will then upload our public datasets.

Our Results are published on [IEICE IA 2016](http://www.ieice.org/ken/paper/20161104Gbmd/eng/)
